      <h2>What Web Development is?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered that what websites are, how they work and how
        they are created?
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites
          and web applications, essentially bringing ideas to life online by
          using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design
          the look, structure, and functionality of a website, ranging from
          simple static pages to complex interactive applications, all
          accessible through a web browser; it typically involves both a
          front-end (user-facing design) and back-end (server-side logic)
          component, allowing users to interact with the website seamlessly.

        <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
        <img src="assets/web-dev1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Front-end development is the part of web development focused on the
          user-facing elements of a website or web application, essentially
          creating the visual design and interactive features that users see and
          interact with directly, primarily using languages like HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Back-end Development</h3>
        <img src="assets/web-dev2.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Back-end development is the process of building the server-side software for a website or mobile app. It involves writing code that controls how the website's front-end appears and functions. Back-end developers are responsible for creating and maintaining the technology that powers the website, including the server, database, and application logic.
